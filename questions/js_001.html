<h5>What is closure in JavaScript?</h5>
<p>A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them even after the outer function has executed.</p>

<!-- Answer Content -->
<h6>Explanation:</h6>
<p>Closures allow for private variables, preserving function states across invocations. This enables data encapsulation and makes functions more powerful in JavaScript.</p>

<h6>Code Example:</h6>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  let a = 1;
  return function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  };
}
const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // Output: 1</code></pre>
