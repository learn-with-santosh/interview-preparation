<h5>What are lifecycle hooks in Angular?</h5>
<p>Lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls at different stages of a component's existence. These hooks allow developers to tap into key events in a component's life cycle, such as creation, changes, and destruction.</p>

<!-- Answer Content -->
<h6>Explanation:</h6>
<p>The main lifecycle hooks in Angular are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ngOnInit:</strong> Called once, after the component's data-bound properties are initialized.</li>
  <li><strong>ngOnChanges:</strong> Invoked when an input property changes.</li>
  <li><strong>ngOnDestroy:</strong> Called right before the component is destroyed.</li>
  <li><strong>ngAfterViewInit:</strong> Called after the component's view and child views are initialized.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Code Example:</h6>
<pre><code>
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-lifecycle',
  template: '<p>Lifecycle demo</p>',
})
export class LifecycleComponent implements OnInit {
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Component initialized');
  }
}
</code></pre>
