<h5>What are directives in Angular?</h5>
<p>Directives are special markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to do something with that element or its children. Angular has three types of directives: component directives, structural directives, and attribute directives.</p>

<h6>Explanation:</h6>
<p>
  - **Component Directives**: These are basically the components themselves.<br>
  - **Structural Directives**: These modify the DOM layout by adding or removing elements (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).<br>
  - **Attribute Directives**: These modify the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., `[ngClass]`, `[ngStyle]`).

</code></pre>
